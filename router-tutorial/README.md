# Overview

This project comes from [here](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v3/docs)

What is not covered is the lifecycle for the router itself. It does documenting something on Component Lifecycle during routing, which is not enough though.

And another thing is dynamic import component during routing.

It's possible to find some clues in the other repos, like [react-admin](https://github.com/yezihaohao/react-admin).
