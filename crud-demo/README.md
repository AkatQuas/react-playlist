# Overview 

Another practice on redux and react-redux, together with react-router v4.

# Notes

In `src/index.js`, check this

```jsx
<Router>
    <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
    </Provider>
</Router>
```

In `src/store/actions.js`, the dipatch function is kind of different from those in `doc-tutorial /***/user-store.js`.

As for Routes, try the vanilla react-route, haha.
