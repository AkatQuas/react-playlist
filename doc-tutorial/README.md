# Overview

This project covers many aspects of ReactJS-core, like stateless components, list-rendering, forms, event-handling, state-and-lifecycle and `Redux`.

# Notes

What is not covered is the `react-router`, router is much easier to use which may be interpreted in the future projects. And a small example is [here](../router-tutorial/README.md)

Havn't find a beautiful way to tackle asynchronounsly actions in the store. `redux-thunk` and `redux-promise` provide some solutions. Waiting for the future projects.

`npm run eject` make it possible to config the project manually.
